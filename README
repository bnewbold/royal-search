This is an index of old (public domain) Royal Society papers dashed out on a
hot afternoon.

Metadata gets tossed into an elasticsearch database for faceted searching
(faceted search doesn't actually work yet through...). The full text of the
papers is not scrapped or indexed, but it wouldn't be hard to do so (try the
ps2ascii UNIX tool?).

Obviously, feel free to hack and improve this!

Local setup instructions
-----------------------------

Download elasticsearch and run it on localhost:9200.

Put all the .txt metadata files in a new folder called "metadata", then run:

  $ ./parse_source_data.py -n metadata/* > data.json
  $ ./create.sh
  $ open search_page/index.html   # or firefox or chromium-browser

There seems to be an encoding bug (sigh) which results in a couple hundred
papers getting lost when loaded into elastic search. And clicking on the facets
doesn't result in proper filtering. And there is no attempt to use proper
reference syntax. usw.
